# Project Title

RGB Color Guesser

# App Description

This application was built to help folks learn their RGB colors and be able to better pick colors on the fly without a color picker.

There are two modes. Easy and Hard.  Easy mode has three squares that show up in the UI, one of those three colors is the correct color.

The correct color is listed in the header as an RGB code.  Try to see if you can pick the right color. If youdo get it all the boxes will change to that color and you win!

You can change your colors if you don't like what you see and start again.

Hard mode has six choices, but only one choice is correct.  Incorrect choices will result in a box being removed, and if you correctly choose, all boxes will change to the correct color as well as the header background as well!

Features:
    Easy and Hard modes
    New Colors. Click this button to cycle through new colors on the fly.
